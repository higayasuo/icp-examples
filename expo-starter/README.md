# `expo-starter`

Welcome to `expo-starter` project.

In this project, you will learn how to authenticate with `Internet Identity` in an Expo app,
connect to an `ICP` `Backend`, and deploy it to run on the Internet Computer Protocol (`ICP`).

This means that native mobile applications can now fully utilize the capabilities of `ICP`.
