The Japanese version is available [here](how_it_works_ja.md).

## What is Internet Identity

Internet Identity is an account system for accessing services on the Internet Computer. While it is equivalent to traditional Google accounts and Apple IDs, it offers the following benefits:

- No collection or tracking of personal information by platform companies
- A decentralized account system suitable for the Web3.0 era
- Secure login using biometric authentication (passkeys)

By addressing the issues of conventional centralized account systems, it realizes a Web3.0-era account service that is more secure and privacy-focused.

The Internet Identity Frontend is provided as a [web application](https://identity.ic0.app/).
